        <h2>Why Visit Kiruna?</h2>
        <div class="why-kiruna">
          <p>
            Kiruna is a unique destination that offers an authentic Arctic
            experience unlike any other. Located 145 kilometers north of the
            Arctic Circle, it's Sweden's northernmost city and a gateway to some
            of the most spectacular natural phenomena on Earth.
          </p>

          <p>
            From <span class="highlight">September to March</span>, Kiruna
            becomes one of the best places in the world to witness the
            <span class="highlight">Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis)</span>.
            The mesmerizing dance of green, purple, and pink lights across the
            Arctic sky is a truly magical experience that draws visitors from
            around the globe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kiruna is also home to the
            <span class="highlight">indigenous Sami people</span>, offering
            visitors a chance to learn about their ancient culture, traditions,
            and reindeer herding way of life. The city itself is undergoing a
            remarkable transformation as it's being moved building by building
            to a new location due to mining subsidence, making it a fascinating
            study in urban planning and resilience.
          </p>

          <p>
